## 📱 Predicting Mobile Phone Prices: A Data-Driven Approach 📊

**Author:** Gangasrinivas Katraji (gangasrinivas27@gmail.com)

**Project Goal:** Help mobile phone companies (like Bob's startup!) make smart pricing and product decisions by uncovering the key factors that influence mobile phone prices.

### 🧐 Unraveling the Data Mystery

**What We Have:** A dataset of 2,000 mobile phones, each with specs like battery power, RAM, camera quality, and more.  Each phone is labeled with its price range (low, medium, high, very high).

**Our Mission:** Use machine learning to crack the code and figure out how these specs translate into prices.

### 🚀 The Journey of Discovery

1.  **🕵️ Data Exploration:** We dug deep into the data, creating colorful charts and graphs to see how battery life, RAM, and other features stack up across different price ranges.

2.  **🛠️ Data Preparation:**  We prepped the data for analysis, making sure everything was neat and tidy for our machine learning models.

3.  **🤖 Model Showdown:** We pitted several machine learning models against each other (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting) to see which one could predict prices most accurately.

4.  **🏆 The Winner:** Logistic Regression emerged as the champion, accurately predicting prices with an impressive 96% accuracy!

5.  **🔍 The Secret Ingredients:** We discovered that battery power, RAM, and screen resolution are the most powerful predictors of a phone's price.

### 💰 Putting Insights into Action

This analysis is more than just numbers – it's a roadmap for Bob's company:

*   **💰 Price with Confidence:** Set prices that align with customer expectations, ensuring your phones are competitive and profitable.
*   **🎯 Target Your Audience:** Design different phone models for different budgets, capturing a wider range of customers.
*   **🚀 Develop Winning Products:** Know exactly what features matter most to customers at each price point, so you can create phones people will love.
*   **📈 Market Smarter:** Craft targeted marketing campaigns that speak directly to specific customer segments.
*   **🔮 Forecast Sales:**  Anticipate demand and make sure you have the right inventory levels to avoid missing out on sales.

### 🤔 What We Learned Along the Way

*   **Data is Gold:** The more data we have, the better our predictions can become.
*   **Feature Power:** Some specs (like battery and RAM) matter more than others when it comes to price.
*   **Models Aren't Perfect:** Even our best model isn't 100% accurate, so it's important to keep learning and improving.

### 📚 Get Started

1.  **Tools of the Trade:** Make sure you have pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn installed.
2.  **Data:** Grab the `datasets_11167_15520_train.csv` file and place it in the same folder as this code.
3.  **Let's Go!** Run the code and uncover the secrets hidden in the data!
